# Windows Error Report file parser
Parses `Report.wer` files that get generated by Windows Error Reporting.

By default will process all accessible files located in folders under `C:\\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER\ReportArchive`. This path can be changed by passing in `-dir` and the path containing the standard file/folder structure.

When running the script, it will generate `wer_results.csv` which contains a subset of field that are logged in the WER file as well as `wer_results.jsonl` which is jsonl file containing the full WER entry.
